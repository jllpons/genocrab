# GenoCrab ðŸ¦€

**GenoCrab**: the Rust-based toolkit that's clawing its way to the top of the genomics food chain ðŸ§¬

## About

GenoCrab brings high-performance computing to genomics, all wrapped up in the efficient, memory-safe embrace of Rust. Born out of an MSc Bioinformatics assignment where no one specifically asked for a CLI tool. *Why Rust? All the cool kids program in Rust*.

## Features

- **Crab-Like Speed**: Experience the 'blazingly fast' (wink, wink) performance, as if your data is scuttling through the sandy beaches of computation.
- **Shell-Shocked Accuracy**: Precision in bioinformatics is key, and GenoCrab doesn't play around. It's as accurate as a crab's claw in a sea of clams.
- **Pinch of Flexibility**: With multiple subcommands for k-Mer Composition, Overlap Graphs, and more, GenoCrab adapts like a crab to the tidal pools of genomic data.

## Getting Started

To get started with GenoCrab, simply clone this repository, make sure you have Rust installed, and run the following command:

```shell
cargo run --release
```
