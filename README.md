## About

GenoCrab brings blazingly fast computing performance to your 
genomics problems. Born out of an MSc Bioinformatics assignment where no one asked for a CLI tool.

## Features

1. **k-Mer Composition**: Display the counts of all posible k-mers of k length
   found in a given sequence ordered lexicographically.

The rest of features are still WIP.
